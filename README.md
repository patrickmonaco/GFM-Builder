# GFM-Builder
Form Builder Tool for Oracle APEX
The purpose of this project is to give to business users a no-code tool for generating forms.

This project called GFM Builder is at prototype stage. It relies mainly on API wich are not documented, even if there are widely used in APEX export App files (before 22.1 version). This approach is clearly no supported, so this tool must be considered as a playground and used in a sandbox only.
GFM Builder addresses mainly companies intranet requirements but citizen portals needs as well.

A common use case is to trigger an administrative process based on informations provided by an employee or a citizen. ie: renewal contrat, ordering internal good, signaling problem in a district, etc.

Usage
Import the file GFM Builder into an Oracle APEX Instance (v22.1 minimum)
Enroll any user and give him Administrator role  in the Shared Components / Application Access Control
Import GFM Sample Store
Run GFM Builder
